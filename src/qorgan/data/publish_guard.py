"""Pre-publish PII gate for the public dataset (ADR D45).

`scripts/hf_upload.py` publishes the processed splits and `data/augment/`. Some splits are
built by `build_corpus` (which scrubs), others are generated or repaired by separate tools
(`ood`, `adversarial*`, `shift`) -- one of them reached the Hub with an unscrubbed IIN. The
guard makes the invariant explicit: every published utterance must already be a
`scrub_text` fixed point, or nothing is uploaded.

`scrub_file` is the repair that establishes that invariant, so finding and fixing cannot
drift apart. It reuses `build_corpus.scrub_dialogue`, which also re-grounds trigger spans
and drops any span that *was* the PII -- a split must never ship a highlight pointing at
`[IIN]`.
